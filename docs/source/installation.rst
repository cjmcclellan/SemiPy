Working With Python
-------------------

If you are new to Python, we recommend you check out some helpful tutorials online.  The syntax and typdef are similar
to Matlab.  We also recommend you use the PyCharm IDE for writing and debugging your code.

To run SemiPy, you must have Python3 on your system and the necessary python libraries.  Please follow the tutorial below
to install on either Windows or Linux (Mac OSX install will be very similar to Linux).
