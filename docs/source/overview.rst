Layout of SemiPy
-------------------

SemiPy is a relatively simple Python library, that revolves around a few base objects, :any:`datasets_page`,
:any:`extractors_page`, and :any:`devices_page`.
These three class types allow users to manage electrical data (DataSets), extract properties from data (Extractors), and
model device physics (Devices).
